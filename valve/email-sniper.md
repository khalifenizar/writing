Dear Valve,

I'm writing to apply for the position of *Senior Software Engineer—Web Applications*. I don't want to take up much of your time, but here's an interesting message sent by someone I believe you are familiar with before his *untimely*... accident. Right, accident.

Trust me, mate, this man is good and you don't want to mess with him. You haven't seen the things he can do with a keyboard, an Internet connection and a standard issue wire hanger. I've seen him code for days on end, waiting patiently for hours — even days — for the perfect time to deploy his handywork. His Jarate skills are most impressive. Lucky for me he's not in the assassination business or I would be out a job right quick or worse...

Anyway, I do browser, server and command-line progamming in `JavaScript`/`node.js` (my favorite), `PHP` and `Python`. I've been writing software professionally to varying degrees for 7 years, of which the last 3 have been particularly intensive. Here are some links where you can find out more about who I am and what I do. Hire me!
