About Nizar
===========

I'm Nizar and I'm a Web developer. I write code for the browser, server and command-line. So far I've done this (competently at least) in `JavaScript` / `node.js`, `PHP` and `Python`. I've been doing it for `AMOUNT` years now.

I like working as part of a team of people I get along with. To me teamwork is fundamentally a dialogue and, as a team member, I care about how myself and others communicate. I try to be polite, funny and, above all, empathetic. When I get really frustrated I curse in Spanish.

I started out in the Web circa 2007 working as a student on the Web page for the [University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras](http://uprrp.edu/). I also made a couple of Web apps while there: a voting system for student council elections and a campus crime log (both lost to the shifting sands of the Internet). After that I worked for [ARBIMON](http://arbimon.com/) building an iOS app for scheduled recording of animal wildlife. In 2011 I began working for [Nobox](http://nobox.com/), a marketing agency based in Miami. There I've worked on all sorts of Web projects (and even another iOS app) for clients such as Mozilla, Copa Airlines, PlayStation, Discovery Networks and Samsung. Since leaving Nobox in 2014, I now take on freelance projects on a contract basis.

I live in `CURRENT_CITY` but am originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. I'm `AGE` years old. I like film, video games, pizza, beer, reading and poking fun at things.

I write funny and unfunny things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/khalifenizar). Occasionally I push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/khalifenizar). You can always email me at [khalifenizar@gmail.com](mailto:khalifenizar@gmail.com) about you or me, anything really. Reach out across the Ã¦ther and talk to me about pizza!
